# Synced into each profile's libraries/ by tools/attestation/sync.py alongside

#
# _attestation_helpers — resolves an (evidence-class, logical-name) pair to a
# full document URI, so controls reference a class + logical name and never a
# hard-coded location. The three evidence classes were ratified in #154 §10.1:
#
#   :leveraged  leveraged-SYSTEM authorizations the boundary inherits
#               (AWS FedRAMP, SOC 2, ISO). One doc <- many controls/profiles
#               (WORM). Base input: leveraged_evidence_base.
#               Maps to `inherited` controls.
#   :policy     policy-PROVIDER documents the boundary leverages (shared /
#               templated / parent-org policies) — a SEPARATE location from the
#               boundary's own docs. One doc <- many controls.
#               Base input: policy_provider_base.
#               Maps to `alternative` policy-category controls.
#   :boundary   the boundary system's OWN docs (Contingency Plan, DRP, IRP,
#               system-specific policies/procedures). One doc <- one/few
#               controls. Base input: boundary_docs_base.
#
# Provider is inferred downstream from the base's URI scheme (s3 / https /
# github / gitlab / file) by the document_attestation resource — the resolver
# only composes strings; it does not know or care which provider it is.
#
# Resolution contract (#154 §3 + ratified clarification):
#   attestation_uri(:boundary, 'C-2.1.3')
#     -> '' when boundary_docs_base is unset  (=> control SKIPs, stays
#        SAF-attestable; never a false Pass or Fail)
#     -> '<boundary_docs_base>/C-2.1.3.md' when the base is set
#
# Logical name (#154 §10.6): defaults to the control_id; pass an explicit name
# for shared/leveraged docs (e.g. 'aws-fedramp-moderate').
#
# Loaded into control bodies via `::Inspec::Rule.include` — bare
# `Inspec::Rule.include` raises uninitialized-constant NameError at exec under
# InSpec 7 (library files load in an anonymous-class context). See
# docs/dev/Vendored_Resource_Gaps.md §6.
